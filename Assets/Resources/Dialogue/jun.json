    },
    {
        "speaker": "Jun",
        "dialogueText": "Mixed Reality. It's a blend of real and virtual worlds, and it's not your usual flashy tech gimmick."

        "speaker": "You",
        "dialogueText": "Oh, I see. So, it's like VR or something?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Jun",
        "dialogueText": "It's more sophisticated than VR. Y  uh ou wear these special goggles that seamlessly integrate virtual elements with the real world. It's efficient for tactical applications."

        "speaker": "Jun",
        "dialogueText": "For some, maybe. But not for me. It's a means to an end, not a virtual escape. I need to stay sharp, and MR helps me maintain an edge."
